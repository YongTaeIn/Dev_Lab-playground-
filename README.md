## 📌 Project Purpose

**The goal of this repository is to rapidly acquire core development knowledge for real-world service operations.**

To operate services stably, you need development skills tailored to your service characteristics. Theory alone is insufficient - you must practice hands-on to apply knowledge in real situations.

**This repository provides:**
- ✅ Curated technologies frequently used in production
- ✅ Ready-to-run example code
- ✅ Step-by-step guides for quick learning
- ✅ Real-world use cases for practical understanding

## 📚 Project List

### 1️⃣ [Kafka Example](./kafka_example)

**Apache Kafka Fundamentals**

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)
[![Kafka](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Kafka-231F20?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache-kafka&logoColor=white)](https://kafka.apache.org/)
[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://www.docker.com/)
[![Conda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conda-44A833?style=for-the-badge&logo=anaconda&logoColor=white)](https://docs.conda.io/)

**🎯 Learning Objectives**  
Understand Kafka Producer/Consumer patterns and build basic message queue systems

**📦 Tech Stack**  
Kafka, Docker, Python, Conda

**💼 Real-World Use Cases**
```
• Asynchronous communication between microservices
  → Order service sends order info to Kafka → Shipping service receives and processes

• Log aggregation system
  → Collect logs from multiple servers via Kafka → Monitor at central log analysis server

• Event-driven architecture
  → Store user behavior events (clicks, purchases) in Kafka → Recommendation & analytics systems consume
```

### 2️⃣ [Kafka + Flink Example](./kafka_flink_example)

**Real-time Stream Data Processing**

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)
[![Kafka](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Kafka-231F20?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache-kafka&logoColor=white)](https://kafka.apache.org/)
[![Flink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Flink-E6526F?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache-flink&logoColor=white)](https://flink.apache.org/)
[![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://www.docker.com/)

**🎯 Learning Objectives**  
Build real-time data pipelines combining Kafka and Flink, understand stream processing

**📦 Tech Stack**  
Kafka, Flink, Docker, Python

**💼 Real-World Use Cases**
```
• Real-time anomaly detection system
  → Collect IoT sensor data via Kafka → Flink analyzes in real-time to detect anomalies → Send alerts

• Real-time recommendation system
  → Collect user clickstream via Kafka → Flink analyzes in real-time → Generate personalized recommendations

• Financial transaction monitoring
  → Receive transaction data via Kafka → Flink detects suspicious transaction patterns in real-time → Block risky transactions

• Real-time dashboard
  → Collect service metrics via Kafka → Flink aggregates and calculates → Display on real-time dashboard
```

### 3️⃣ [Python Asyncio Example](./python_asyncio_example)

**Python Asynchronous Programming**

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)

**🎯 Learning Objectives**  
Master Python asyncio fundamentals and understand performance optimization

**📦 Tech Stack**  
Python asyncio

**💼 Real-World Use Cases**
```
• API server development
  → Build high-performance async web servers using FastAPI, aiohttp
  → Handle thousands of concurrent requests

• Web crawling/scraping
  → Crawl hundreds of web pages simultaneously
  → 10x+ speed improvement over sequential processing

• Database batch operations
  → Execute multiple DB queries concurrently
  → Minimize I/O wait time

• External API calls
  → Call multiple external service APIs simultaneously to reduce response time
```
